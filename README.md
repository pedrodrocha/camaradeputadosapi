The goal of `camaradeputadosapi` is to ease access and provide a clean
interface in R for querying the Brazilian House of Representatives open
data [RESTful API](https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/swagger/api.html).

The package is under active development, but some functionalities are
already on. Note that in this state of the project there isnâ€™t proper
documentation and breaking changes are expected. In any case, user
feedback is welcome and valued.

## Instalation

You can install the latest development version from Github with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pedrodrocha/camaradeputadosapi")
```

## Usage

In its final stage the package is expected to cover nine families of
functions for querying each one a type of data provided by the API:

  - `deputados()` & `deputados_*()`: For querying data on
    representatives that are or once were in office.  
  - `eventos()` & `eventos_*()`: For querying data on events that
    occurred or are scheduled.  
  - `frentes()` & `frentes_*()`: For querying data on parliamentary
    fronts.  
  - `legislaturas()` & `legislaturas_*()`: For querying data on
    legislative periods.  
  - `partidos()` & `partidos_*()`: For querying data on political
    parties.  
  - `proposicoes()` & `proposicoes_*()`: For querying data on
    propositions.  
  - `votacoes()` & `votacoes_*()`: For querying data on voting processes
    (**NOT AVAILABLE YET**).
  - `orgaos()` & `orgaos_*()`: For querying data on commissions and
    other legislative bodies (**NOT AVAILABLE YET**).  
  - `referencias_*()`: For querying data on available variables and its
    values (**NOT AVAILABLE YET**).

**OBS:** By default the API returns only 15 results per request and the
limit is 100 results. When appropriate make sure to add `itens= N` as a
parameter for greater control.
